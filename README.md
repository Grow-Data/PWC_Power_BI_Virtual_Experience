# Power_BI_Projects
The Power BI PwC Virtual Internship is an online program provided by PwC, a prominent professional services firm. It offers hands-on experience with Power BI, a robust tool for data visualization and business intelligence. The internship mainly comprises three tasks. Before diving into the tasks, I shared my thoughts in a text field to set the mood for my Power BI experience. I expressed my eagerness to learn, excitement about the virtual internship, expectations, and the opportunity to understand how leading companies operate in the data field.

## Task1
This task involves creating a Power BI dashboard for managers, displaying relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics from the dataset. The Call Center Use Case allowed me to practice core skills in data visualization by highlighting operational aspects and agents performance.

# Task2
This task involved creating a dashboard for the retention manager that effectively captures and presents the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention. Following a thorough analysis breakdown, I have presented detailed causes and recommended the optimal course of action. This was accomplished by creating measures using DAX and presenting the insights through visualizations.

# Task3
Here, I have translated the human resources analysis and personnel segmentation of PwC Switzerland employees into compelling visual representations. Through this project, I gained insights into PwC's diversity and inclusion mission statement, understanding its significance in guiding decisions for the well-being of their employees. Employing DAX and suitable visuals in Power BI enhanced the effectiveness of communicating these valuable findings.
